# Setup Guide for Training Improvements

## What's Been Added

### 1. Progress Bars During Training
Each epoch now shows:
- Training progress bar with real-time loss/accuracy
- Validation progress bar with real-time loss/accuracy
- Visual feedback on training progress

### 2. Epoch Timing
Each epoch displays:
- Total time taken for the epoch
- Helps estimate remaining training time

### 3. Percentage Display
Accuracy now shows as both:
- Decimal: `0.2852`
- Percentage: `(28.52%)`

### 4. Improved Model Architecture
New training script with:
- 256 LSTM units (up from 150)
- 3 LSTM layers (up from 2)
- 128 embedding dimensions (up from 100)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Required Package (tqdm)
```bash
pip install tqdm
```

Or install all requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Training

#### Option A: Current Model with Improvements
```bash
python app/train.py
```
This uses your current architecture (150 units, 2 layers) but with progress bars and timing.

#### Option B: Improved Model Architecture
```bash
python app/train_improved.py
```
This uses the enhanced architecture (256 units, 3 layers) with all improvements.

## What You'll See During Training

### Before (Old Output):
```
Epoch 1/100
  Train Loss: 5.5719, Train Acc: 0.1782
  Val Loss: 5.1114, Val Acc: 0.1827
```

### After (New Output):
```
Epoch 1/100 [Train]: 100%|████████████| 7393/7393 [02:34<00:00, 47.84batch/s, loss=5.5719, acc=0.1782]
Epoch 1/100 [Val]:   100%|████████████| 822/822 [00:12<00:00, 67.23batch/s, loss=5.1114, acc=0.1827]
Epoch 1/100 - Time: 166.52s
  Train Loss: 5.5719, Train Acc: 0.1782 (17.82%)
  Val Loss: 5.1114, Val Acc: 0.1827 (18.27%)
  [OK] Model saved (val_loss improved)
```

You'll see:
- Real-time progress bars for each phase
- Batches processed per second
- Current loss and accuracy during training
- Total epoch time in seconds
- Accuracy as percentage

## Understanding the Progress Bars

### Training Bar:
```
Epoch 30/100 [Train]: 100%|████████████| 7393/7393 [02:34<00:00, 47.84batch/s, loss=3.5801, acc=0.3146]
```
- `7393/7393`: Current batch / Total batches
- `[02:34<00:00]`: Time elapsed / Time remaining
- `47.84batch/s`: Processing speed
- `loss=3.5801, acc=0.3146`: Current metrics

### Validation Bar:
```
Epoch 30/100 [Val]: 100%|████████████| 822/822 [00:12<00:00, 67.23batch/s, loss=3.9023, acc=0.2852]
```
Same format as training, but for validation phase.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No module named 'tqdm'"
**Solution**: Install tqdm
```bash
pip install tqdm
```

### Issue: Progress bars don't display properly
**Solution**: This is normal in some terminals. The progress will still work, just may not animate smoothly.

### Issue: Training seems slower
**Reason**: The progress bar adds minimal overhead (< 1%). If it feels slower, it's likely because you can now see exactly how long each batch takes.

## Next Steps

1. Install tqdm: `pip install tqdm`
2. Choose training script:
   - `train.py` for current model with improvements
   - `train_improved.py` for better accuracy
3. Run training and monitor progress in real-time
4. See `TRAINING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` for tips on improving validation accuracy

## Comparison: Training Time Estimates

### Your Current Setup (30 epochs in 10 hours):
- **Per epoch**: ~20 minutes
- **100 epochs**: ~33 hours
- **Expected final accuracy**: 30-32%

### With Improved Model (256 units, 3 layers):
- **Per epoch**: ~30-35 minutes (slower, but more powerful)
- **100 epochs**: ~50-58 hours
- **Expected final accuracy**: 32-37%

### With Vocabulary Limiting (20k words):
- **Per epoch**: ~12-15 minutes (faster output layer)
- **100 epochs**: ~20-25 hours
- **Expected final accuracy**: 40-50%

**Recommendation**: Implement vocabulary limiting for best results per training time.
